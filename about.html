      <dd>
        ilastik is a simple, user-friendly tool for <b>interactive image classification,
        segmentation and analysis</b>. It is built as a modular software framework, which
        currently has <a href="/documentation/index.html">workflows</a> for automated (supervised) pixel- and object-level classification,
        automated and semi-automated object tracking, semi-automated segmentation
        and object counting without detection.
        Most analysis operations are performed <b>lazily</b>, which enables targeted interactive
        processing of data subvolumes, followed by complete volume analysis in offline batch mode. Using it
        requires no experience in image processing.
