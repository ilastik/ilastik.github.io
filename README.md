# ilastik.org [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/eff31aab-733c-4301-919b-ace9c279097b/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/ilastik/deploys)

The source for the [ilastik website](https://www.ilastik.org) served via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).

## Development Instructions

To develop these pages locally, follow the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/) to get set up.
To serve the site locally, run:

    bundle exec jekyll serve

Remember to check your links using [linkchecker](https://wummel.github.io/linkchecker/) or [muffet](https://github.com/raviqqe/muffet)

    # Use one of the following
    linkchecker http://localhost:4000
    muffet http://localhost:4000

## How to Add News

Create a Markdown file `news/_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-your-hyphen-separated-title-here.md` with the desired publish date:
```markdown
---
title: Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything
---

Write an article using simple Markdown.
The first paragraph is special because it is used for article previews.
```

A work-in-progress article can be saved as `news/_drafts/your-hyphen-separated-title-here.md` and moved to `news/_posts` with the correct publish date later.

Consult the [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/) for more details.

## Notes

* Every page should have exactly **one** `<h1>` header at the top (in Markdown indicated by a single `#`),
  all further headings should be 2nd later headings and thus start with `##`.
  This way the table of contents in the menu on the left can be autogenerated properly.

* ilastik is spelled in lowercase everywhere, including beginnings of sentences

* Zoom effects in the screenshots are made using the [zoom selection script](https://gimpchat.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=3374) for [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org).

* Use `Rakefile` to define various maintenance tasks.
