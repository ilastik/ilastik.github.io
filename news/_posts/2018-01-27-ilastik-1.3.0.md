We are happy to announce a new [ilastik release](/download.html), based on Python3 and Qt5!
Detailed release notes can be found [here](https://github.com/ilastik/ilastik/wiki/Release-Notes#ilastik-130-26-january-2018), in short, it's much better, go ahead and try! The GUI is faster, the tracking does not need CPLEX, we have new export formats, and much more.
