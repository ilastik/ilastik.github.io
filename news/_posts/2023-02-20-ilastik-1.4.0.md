We are happy to announce the release of the new stable [ilastik version `1.4.0`]({{site.baseurl}}/download.html#stable).

Among many other improvements, this release contains the a new workflow, [the Neural Network Classification workflow]({{site.baseurl}}/documentation/nn/nn.html). This workflow allows you to apply pre-trained neural networks on your own data. Where do you find the networks? At the community-driven [Bioimage.io Model Zoo](https://bioimage.io)! If there is no network for your problem yet, give it some time, or contribute one yourself!

**Release Highlights:**
  * [Neural Network Workflow]({{site.baseurl}}/documentation/nn/nn.html): run pre-trained neural networks from [Bioimage.io Model Zoo](https://bioimage.io) in ilastik
  * Better default features in the [Multicut Workflow]({{site.baseurl}}/documentation/multicut/multicut.html)
  * redo/undo for brush-strokes
  * many bugfixes throughout

**New Contributors for this release**:
