title: "New stable ilastik release 1.4.0"
---

We are happy to announce the release of the new stable [ilastik version `1.4.0`]({{site.baseurl}}/download.html#stable).

Among many other improvements, this release contains the a new workflow, [the Neural Network Classification workflow]({{site.baseurl}}/documentation/nn/nn.html). This workflow allows you to apply pre-trained neural networks on your own data. Where do you find the networks? At the community-driven [Bioimage.io Model Zoo](https://bioimage.io)! If there is no network for your problem yet, give it some time, or contribute one yourself!

**Release Highlights:**
  * [Neural Network Workflow]({{site.baseurl}}/documentation/nn/nn.html): run pre-trained neural networks from [Bioimage.io Model Zoo](https://bioimage.io) in ilastik
    * Networks can run on CPU, GPU (choose the GPU build for Windows, or Linux), or on a remote server
    * No Neural Network training, yet - we're working on it.
  * New startup screen!
  * Major UI and performance improvements for the [Multicut Workflow]({{site.baseurl}}/documentation/multicut/multicut.html)
  * Stability/Usability improvements in the [Carving Workflow]({{site.baseurl}}/documentation/carving/carving.html)
  * By popular demand: redo/undo for brush-strokes
  * Many bugfixes throughout

**New Contributors for this release**:
  * Development team: Benedikt Best, Emil Melnikov, Maksim Novikov, Tomaz Vieira
  * Outside contributors: Sebastien Herbert, Jonas Hund, Boaz Mohar, Constantin Pape
