title: "ilastik native builds for apple silicon (arm64)"
---

Starting with [beta version][beta] `1.4.1b5`, we are distributing ilastik with native builds for apple silicon computers.

We would appreciate users with apple silicon computers giving the beta version a go.
Processing should be much faster than before!
We appreciate any feedback :). 

Current limitation on apple silicon: in the Neural Network Classification Workflow (and the Trainable Domain Adaptation Workflow), only 2D networks will work, while 3D networks will fail.
